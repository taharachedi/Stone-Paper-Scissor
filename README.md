## ⚙️ How It Works  

### Core Components  
1. **Player and Computer Choices**:  
   - The player selects a choice (Stone, Paper, or Scissors 🪨📄✂️).  
   - The computer generates its choice randomly.  

2. **Game Logic**:  
   - **Enum-based structure** organizes the choices and winner calculation.  
   - Round winners are determined based on the traditional rules of Stone-Paper-Scissors:  
     - 🪨 Stone beats ✂️ Scissors.  
     - 📄 Paper beats 🪨 Stone.  
     - ✂️ Scissors beat 📄 Paper.  

3. **Results Tracking**:  
   - **Per Round**: Tracks choices and the winner for each round.  
   - **Overall**: Aggregates total wins, losses, and draws to determine the final game winner.
